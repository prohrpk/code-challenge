## Developer Challenge

The objective of this challenge is to hit an endpoint containing the list of jobs and perform some actions on the result.
The challenge must be solved in NodeJs or Javascript .

## Requirements and Output

#### Create a One Page Website to **allow**
##### Add a Job
##### Search Job

## Add Job Feature
- Job title
- City
- Salary range
- Start date
- End date 

## Search Job
  #### search by job title, city, salary range, start date, end date
  - Job title
  - Salary
  - City
  - Start Date
  - End Date
  #### allow sorting by:
  - Job title
  - Salary
  - Date

This is including search by multiple criteria in the same time like search by city and salary together.

## Conditions

- You can use any framework or tool, You also can build it all also from scratch if you like
- Use JSON files to store data of jobs
- Write full test using any test suite Jest for JS, Whatever you prefer
- Use [codeclimate](https://codeclimate.com) or any other alternative to estimate the code quality and add it's badge to your project README file
- Do not use any database or any full text search engines all searches should be developed manullay without using any external libraries.
- If you make any assumptions, mention them clearly in the readme file

## What we are looking for

- **Simple, clear, readable code** How well structured it is? Clear separation of concerns? Can anyone just look at it and get the idea to
what is being done? Does it follow any standards?
- **Correctness** Does the application do what it promises? Can we find bugs or trivial flaws?
- **Security** are there any obvious vulnerability?
- **Memory efficiency** How will it behave in case of large datasets?
- **Testing** How well tested your application is? Can you give some metrics?
- **Documentation** Is the code self documented and it's easy to understand it by just reading?


## Commit History
- Use whatever development workflow works best for you. If your solution is small enough and a single commit is justified, that's fine; we just ask that you keep your commit history as coherent as possible.

## Questions & Delivery

If you have any questions about this challenge, please do reach out to us.

The challenge solution should be delivered as a link to a public git repository (github.com or bitbucket.com are preferred).

## Checklist

Before submitting, make sure that your program

- [ ] Code accompanies the Unit Tests
- [ ] Usage is clearly mentioned in the README file, This including setup the project, how to run it, how to run unit test, examples,etc
- [ ] Uses the endpoint directly

## Note

Implementations focusing on **quality over feature completeness** will be highly appreciated, donâ€™t feel compelled to implement everything and even if you are not able to complete the challenge, please do submit it anyways. As we are more concerned to quality of work rather than completion of task.
